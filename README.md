Bus Scheduling App

This is a Bus Scheduling app that allows the user to create and edit bus schedules.

For the example below we will use a schedule for San Franciscoâ€™s 38 Geary bus.

This app allows the user to

* Shows the user which trips are currently assigned to each bus
* Allows the user to move trips from one bus to another, without creating conflicts

The basic idea is shown on this GIF. Each row represents a bus, each rectangle represents a trip, and the X-axis represents time.
